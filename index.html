          <h2>A digital textual analysis approach to the works of Robert Frost</h2>
          <p>
            The premise for this project stems from the popularity of Robert Frost's poetry, as well the recurring topic that the popular poem, "The Road Not Taken",
            is frequently misread or misunderstood by the general public. Seeing that little to no work has been done on Robert Frost's poetry from a Digital Humanities
            approach, it would be interesting to examine Frost's poetry through the lens of digital textual analysis approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            The collections that are used for this project include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>North of Boston, 1914</li>
            <li>A Boy's Will, 1915</li>
            <li>Mountain Interval, 1916</li>
            <li>Miscellaneous Poems to 1920</li>
            <li>Others (a set of 5 others)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This project begins with the hypothesis that there is something that stands out about Frost's "The Road Not Taken" from others which may correlate with its popularity.
            We will be examining the poem at both the structural level, assisted by textual analysis tools, and statistical analysis from tone scores retrieved from Natural Language Processing
            performed by IBM Watson.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this project may have a focus on "The Road Not Taken", we will be looking at all of Frost's work (that was retrieved for this study) in the hopes
            that there will be interesting patterns across the different poems which can reveal new insight into Frost's poetry.

          <h2 class="text-center">Extract, Transform, Load</h2>
          <p>
            To begin the study, I had to first retrieve and build the corpus. There's <a href="https://archive.org/details/poemsofrobertfro029898mbp">an online source for a complete collection of Robert Frost's poetry in entirety</a>.
            However, it wasn't properly OCR'd, and I had to look for a way to extract data in a way that can be used separately rather than in one contiguous text form.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/people/Frost-Ro.html">Bartleby's database of poetry items</a>, and thankfully due to the way the site has been organized, it was easy to pull out poems from individual publications with a simple script.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next part, I used a series of NodeJS scripts to prepare my documents for generating a corpus.
            I scrubbed out the poems' whitespaces so as to extract the stanzas in their pre-existing formatted form (something I was unable to do with the PDF's OCR text corpus).
            The poems are titled according to the format <code>"Year - Title"</code> so as to prepare the data should there arise a need for a timeline to be drawn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I wanted to build the poem samples separately was due to the intentions of using Voyant Tools to run a corpus analysis on the text.
            By having the poems in separate documents, it was clearer to view the document differences in Voyant.
          </p>
          <p>You may refer to the scripts used to generate the corpus and for data preparation <a href="https://github.com/jhowtan/frost-poetry-dh/tree/master/scripts">here</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Voyant Tools</h2>
          <p>
            As one of the most extensive textual analysis tools built for the purposes in Digital Humanities, I felt that it was most appropriate to begin inspecting the poetry works using Voyant Tools
            as a first cut at the data set that I've retrieved. It is in the hopes of using Voyant that either interpretation or word count analysis will reveal more about the corpus that we are investigating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should Voyant reveal any shortcomings in the process, I will take the steps necessary to evaluate what other parameters should be supplemented
            for more extensive approaches at examining the corpus.
          </p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-offset-2 col-md-8">
          <h2 class="text-center">IBM Watson</h2>
          <p>To add on to another dimension of the text analysis, I was inspired to use the IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API to process the poems at scale.</p>
          <p>
            The IBM Watson's API is useful because it provides a comprehensive psycholinguistic model to analyse the text we are supplying the model.
            In doing so, I am able to retrieve scores on the tone of the document, which is backed by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/tone-analyzer/science.html">some very heavy research in language tones</a>.
            The tones are evaluated in three aspects, Emotional, Social, and Language tones, which are described in detail on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/tone-analyzer/understand-tone.html">Understanding your tone score</a>.
          </p>
          <p>To make use of this service, I made use of the pre-existing poem files and fed them to the IBM Bluemix Watson Services, which <a href="https://github.com/jhowtan/frost-poetry-dh/blob/master/scripts/watson.js">can be found in this script.</a></p>
          <p>
            With Watson, I scoped the level of analysis to be at document level rather than at sentence level. This is so that we can focus more on the individual poems as a whole rather than go deep
            into the granular sentence level to detect variances in tone. Of course, doing so at the sentence level is also possible, but will require a careful setup for it to yield meaningful, useful results to analyse at a high level.
          </p>
          <p>
            The API also offered to extract keywords from each poem. I limited the response to return 10 top keywords according to their sentiment scores, hoping that it may be used at some point.

            The most immediate thing was to see if there were any trends between the words used across the different collections.
            In the following Cirrus visualisations of the words used per document/corpus, a term scale of 85 was used to see if there are any repetitive words used.
            This set of words are also retrieved after applying a filter from the stop words list provided by Voyant Tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arguably, much can be done from these word clouds. For instance, the top/most frequently used words can be used in forming n-grams to perform an n-grams analysis
            through Google Books' N-gram viewer to see if any of these terms yield an increase in popularity over certain time periods, so as to investigate if a correlation
            exists between the words used in "The Road Not Taken" and in popular culture (in books).

            At a glance, we can only tell that The Road Not Taken has a set of very unique vocabulary when looked at singularly.
            It is hard to tell if there is any real impact in those words used in The Road Not Taken compared across the entire collection of poems retrieved.
            We can tell based on the frequency of words used in the respective collections and the entire corpus that the words frequently used are simple monosyllablic words.
            Beyond that, there is not much else we can gather from the word clouds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voyant has a Document summary feature that returns a statistics on each poem. However, the approach of counting words and sentences may not be useful when looking
            at a poem's structure. As such, I had to write my own word count evaluation of the poetry from the perspective of the stanzas, lines, and words instead of sentences
            (which is also taken into consideration).
          </p>
          <p>I went ahead to extend on the textual statistics on each poem stored it back into JSON format.</p>
          <p>With the additional parsing and data manipulation, we get the following new attributes for each poem:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collection</li>
            <li>Year Published</li>
            <li>Stanzas</li>
            <li>Lines</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From these additional parameters, we're able to get even more interesting ratios to work with, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lines per Stanza</li>
            <li>Words per Stanza</li>
            <li>Words per Line</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of which are definitely more relevant and consumable with regards to textual analysis on poetry.</p>
          <p>
            With the data table now generated on this page, we are able to quickly learn a few things about the poetry. Displaying only 10 results, sorting
            the order ascendingly or descendingly will give you a perspective of the top or bottom 10 poems according to the metric we want to find out by.

            For instance, If we want to know which poem has the greatest number of words per stanza, we're able to sort by that column and we find out a few
            interesting details about those with a higher word density. There are other things we can do rather quickly with this table that reveal some preliminary
            insight into the statistics across the entire collection.

            The following graph below is generated through Watson's Natural Language Understanding API, and yields the overall sentiment

            The sentiment scores range from -1 to 1, where a positive value indicate a better sentiment, and a negative value
            indicating a poorer sentiment in terms of the tone of the document. Each document was sent to be scored by the machine,
            which is then analyzed based on the textual contents of the document as a whole instead of using targeted phrases.

              When ordered by <code>year_published</code>, the poems spanning from 1909 to 1922 generally show a trend
              of negative sentiment. The sentiment score was returned on the overall document that was passed over to the
              Watson API for analysis. Frost's "The Road Not Taken" is not spared from the general sentiment of negativity
              (according to Watson) as well, with a sentiment score of <code>-0.685</code>.

            <p>With the whisker plot shown on the left, we can see that Frost's "The Road Not Taken" lies beyond the lower bound
            of the overall negative sentiments of all his poetry written in this corpus (and is also in fact the most negative in sentiment scores).</p>
            <p>This makes "The Road Not Taken" an <strong>outlier</strong> in terms of its negative sentiment, as it is the only outlier in the set of
            negative sentiments. This makes "The Road Not Taken" more negative in its sentiment score than the others with a score of
            <code>-0.68531</code>.</p>
            <p>It thus seems that "The Road Not Taken" is an unusually bitter piece written, albeit scored by a machine in terms of
            detecting negativity in tone.</p>

              "The Road Not Taken" is preset as the default poem to display for its tone analysis scores. In each of the panels, it reveals some information
              about what the Watson Tone Analyzer service has found on the contents of the poem. Scores greater than <code>0.5</code> indicate a greater likelihood
              of the tone property, and vice versa.

              In this section, I have also provided a switch for readers to switch between all poetry that can be obtained from this corpus, beginning from 1909 to 1922.
              Select another poem to observe the changes in the tone scores. Results from these three panels can be compared to the boxplots generated below to compare
              the tone scores against the collection of poems at large.

                <p>
                  Looking at the boxplots for each of the emotional tone vectors retrieved from the data, we can see that there is very little
                  variance between the Anger and Disgust emotions, as well as the fact that the range of scores also indicate that Frost's poetry
                  is also not reflective of those tones in his expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, there is greatest variance in Fear and Joy across his poems. "The Road Not Taken" has been deemed unlikely
                  to be conveying any of these emotions according to the legend (scores of less than 0.5 indicates that it is unlikely) as seen
                  from above in the Emotional Tone panel.

                  It was interesting to observe that none of the poems were scored for Confidence in terms of the language tone, which implies
                  that there is no evidence of confidence in the tone of the poems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, tentativeness has the largest variance, which reveals a varying degree of inhibition that Frost has in his language
                  expressed in the poems. As the bulk of the scores appear to be a low value score (less than 0.5), implying that there is little evidence of these tones in the poetry,
                  Nothing conclusive can be said about these language tone scores.

                  While it may seem like a long shot, we can infer the characteristics of Frost's personality through his text based on the spread of these results.
                  We see that there is some likely evidence of Openneess and Agreeableness in Frost's poetry, which stand out more than the other personality traits.

            Structurally, it does not seem like anything much stands out from the poem compared to the others. As it stands, it seems that I am unable to conclude on this point,
            which may be because I may not be looking at the right parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be presumptuous to make sweeping statements about "The Road Not Taken" based on the findings that this study has provided and shown. While the poem
            may have stood out in terms of its negative sentiment score, each and every poem written by Frost should not be trivialised to a score. It was also interesting
            to note the differences that "The Road Not Taken" has with the rest of the poems as a whole, perhaps more can be done by segmenting according to their collections,
            or perhaps across time periods (maybe according to the year of publishing) to gain a more granular understanding of the differences in the poems.

          <h2 class="text-center">Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            As Digital Humanities is like an 'open sandbox' field of study, there seems to be a lack of best practices and documentation going around for how to
            approach the analysis of literary text (in this case). Most tools that are provided by scientists and DH scholars mostly tell you what they are for,
            but not quite thoroughly on how to use them effectively. For instance, with Voyant Tools, unless I have had the literary training to approach the subject,
            the visualisations and content distilled from the corpus meant very little to me, and it was also hard to spot any patterns unless further manipulation
            is performed (as evidenced in the course of this project).
          </p>
          <p>
            Visualisations work much better on quantitative sets of data, and it was also hard to visualize some sets of the data in terms of multiple parameters (for
            example, comparing words per line to, perhaps the year of publishing to observe any trends in verbosity) because the published year of the book is not
            distinctively discrete (many published in the same year). It was also hard to discern what would be a good approach to choose parameters for analysis because
            properties like word count seem so arbitrary and lack meaning unless applied to an appropriate context.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">Academic Training (or lack thereof)</h2>
          <p>
            It would perhaps been better should I have been more rigorously grounded in any of the relevant areas in this DH study. These areas include the domains of
            statistical analysis, and literary training. My main concern was that I was trying hard not to force the data in any way to fit the hypothesis I was testing for.
            There would undoubtedly be more that I could have looked into, perhaps with fairer comparison methods to gain a more objective point of view on the corpus.
            That said, I am also sure that there may be biases that will be implicated.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">Deciding on Scope</h2>
          <p>
            I tried adopting a storytelling approach to this project. I assumed some basic premises before setting off on this journey of discovery
            based on the text corpus and statistic analysis on the Watson data. Then I went on to bring the reader (you!) through my thought processes
            and the methods I've used to visualise and investigate the corpus. I found this to be an interesting manner of representing my stream of consciousness
            when looking at the results of the textual analysis tools, but it was also risky should there be inconclusive results from the findings.
          </p>
            Choosing a topic to look into has probably been the hardest part for this project since the DH methods are so broadly applied, and it seemed as though
            I had to be careful not to treat the digital methods as a hammer to every nail.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">Further Extensions</h2>
          <p>
            There is definitely more that one can do with the data, even from such a small scope of 90 poems. With more poems (and text) to be put through such

            From the structural analysis point of view, I could have done more in terms of looking at poetry forms in a stricter manner. The groups of form, primarily,
            the Lyric, Narrative, and Dramatic forms were not explored widely enough in this DH project, and I could have gone deeper to look into the stanzaic, fixed,
            and continuous forms of the poetry. Unfortunately, it was difficult or impossible to find a database out there which has already performed such analysis
            on the poetry for me to perform other visualisations for comparison purposes. This may perhaps be a suitable extension in this study.

            The Watson API also provided some interesting results in terms of its keyword analysis as shown in the table above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keywords are not retrieved the way it was done on Voyant Tools, whereby words are looked at singularly. Rather, it seems to have generated n-grams (up to 2) of
            the keywords found in each poem (according to the relevance to the overall body of the poem). The relevance scores for each term are ranked for each of the 10 terms
            (I specified a return of the top 10 most relevant terms, but the API service is able to accommodate more), and a sentiment value, amongst others like the emotion tone
            scores for the keywords are also provided in the table above, much like what we have gathered in the <a href="#tone">Tone Analysis section</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            By exploring this set of keywords further, we may be able to find more useful and interesting relationships with the overall corpus as compared to plainly using
            Voyant Tools. For the scope of this project, efforts to pursue this aspect of the analysis is too ambitious and excessive to undertake.
            The keyword analysis offered some sentiment analysis on the words used and their tones, which could also have been useful to analyse broadly to investigate
            if there exists other patterns which may reveal more insight.
