          <h2>A digital textual analysis approach to the works of Robert Frost</h2>
          <p>
            The premise for this project stems from the popularity of Robert Frost's poetry, as well the recurring topic that the popular poem, "The Road Not Taken",
            is frequently misread or misunderstood by the general public. Seeing that little to no work has been done on Robert Frost's poetry from a Digital Humanities
            approach, it would be interesting to examine Frost's poetry through the lens of digital textual analysis approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            The collections that are used for this project include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>North of Boston, 1914</li>
            <li>A Boy's Will, 1915</li>
            <li>Mountain Interval, 1916</li>
            <li>Miscellaneous Poems to 1920</li>
            <li>Others (a set of 5 others)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This project begins with the hypothesis that there is something structurally different about Frost's "The Road Not Taken" from the others. This may be a cause for the misreading of the
            poem. While this project may have a focus on "The Road Not Taken", we will be looking at all of Frost's work (that was retrieved for this study) in the hopes
            that there will be interesting patterns across the different poems which can reveal new insight into Frost's poetry.

          <h2>Information Retrieval</h2>
          <p>
            To begin the study, I had to first retrieve and build the corpus. There's <a href="https://archive.org/details/poemsofrobertfro029898mbp">an online source for a complete collection of Robert Frost's poetry in entirety</a>.
            However, it wasn't properly OCR'd, and I had to look for a way to extract data in a way that can be used separately rather than in one contiguous text form.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/people/Frost-Ro.html">Bartleby's database of poetry items</a>, and thankfully due to the way the site has been organized, it was easy to pull out poems from individual publications with a simple script.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next part, I used a series of NodeJS scripts to prepare my documents for generating a corpus.
            I scrubbed out the poems' whitespaces so as to extract the stanzas in their pre-existing formatted form (something I was unable to do with the PDF's OCR text corpus).
            The poems are titled according to the format <code>"Year - Title"</code> so as to prepare the data should there arise a need for a timeline to be drawn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I wanted to build the poem samples separately was due to the intentions of using Voyant Tools to run a corpus analysis on the text.
            By having the poems in separate documents, it was clearer to view the document differences in Voyant.
          </p>
          <p>You may refer to the scripts used to generate the corpus and data for this project <a href="https://github.com/jhowtan/frost-poetry-dh/tree/master/scripts">here</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>Voyant Tools</h2>
          <p>
            As one of the most extensive textual analysis tools built for the purposes in Digital Humanities, I felt that it was most appropriate to begin inspecting the poetry works using Voyant Tools
            as a first cut at the data set that I've retrieved. It is in the hopes of using Voyant that either interpretation or word count analysis will reveal more about the corpus that we are investigating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should Voyant reveal any shortcomings in the process, I will take the steps necessary to evaluate what other parameters should be supplemented
            for more extensive approaches at examining the corpus.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>IBM Watson</h2>
          <p>To add on to another dimension of the text analysis, I was inspired to use the IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API to process the poems at scale.</p>
          <p>
            The IBM Watson's API is useful because it provides a comprehensive psycholinguistic model to analyse the text we are supplying the model.
            In doing so, I am able to retrieve scores on the tone of the document, which is backed by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/tone-analyzer/science.html">some very heavy research in language tones</a>.
            The tones are evaluated in three aspects, Emotional, Social, and Language tones, which are described in detail on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/tone-analyzer/understand-tone.html">Understanding your tone score</a>.
          </p>
          <p>To make use of this service, I made use of the pre-existing poem files and fed them to the IBM Bluemix Watson Services, which <a href="https://github.com/jhowtan/frost-poetry-dh/blob/master/scripts/watson.js">can be found in this script.</a></p>
          <p>
            With Watson, I scoped the level of analysis to be at document level rather than at sentence level. This is so that we can focus more on the individual poems as a whole rather than go deep
            into the granular sentence level to detect variances in tone. Of course, doing so at the sentence level is also possible, but will require a careful setup for it to yield meaningful, useful results to analyse at a high level.
          </p>
          <p>
            The API also offered to extract keywords from each poem. I limited the response to return 10 top keywords according to their sentiment scores, hoping that it may be used at some point.

            The most immediate thing was to see if there were any trends between the words used across the different collections.
            In the following Cirrus visualisations of the words used per document/corpus, a term scale of 85 was used to see if there are any repetitive words used.
            This set of words are also retrieved after applying a filter from the stop words list provided by Voyant Tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arguably, much can be done from these word clouds. For instance, the top/most frequently used words can be used in forming n-grams to perform an n-grams analysis
            through Google Books' N-gram viewer to see if any of these terms yield an increase in popularity over certain time periods, so as to investigate if a correlation
            exists between the words used in "The Road Not Taken" and in popular culture (in books).

            At a glance, we can only tell that The Road Not Taken has a set of very unique vocabulary when looked at singularly.
            It is hard to tell if there is any real impact in those words used in The Road Not Taken compared across the entire collection of poems retrieved.
            We can tell based on the frequency of words used in the respective collections and the entire corpus that the words frequently used are simple monosyllablic words.
            Beyond that, there is not much else we can gather from the word clouds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voyant has a Document summary feature that returns a statistics on each poem. However, the approach of counting words and sentences may not be useful when looking
            at a poem's structure. As such, I had to write my own word count evaluation of the poetry from the perspective of the stanzas, lines, and words instead of sentences
            (which is also taken into consideration).
          </p>
          <p>I went ahead to extend on the textual statistics on each poem stored it back into JSON format.</p>
          <p>With the additional parsing and data manipulation, we get the following new attributes for each poem:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collection</li>
            <li>Year Published</li>
            <li>Stanzas</li>
            <li>Lines</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From these additional parameters, we're able to get even more interesting ratios to work with, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lines per Stanza</li>
            <li>Words per Stanza</li>
            <li>Words per Line</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of which are definitely more relevant and consumable with regards to textual analysis on poetry.</p>
          <p>
            With the data table now generated on this page, we are able to quickly learn a few things about the poetry. Displaying only 10 results, sorting
            the order ascendingly or descendingly will give you a perspective of the top or bottom 10 poems according to the metric we want to find out by.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, If we want to know which poem has the greatest number of words per stanza, we're able to sort by that column and we find out a few
            interesting details about those with a higher word density. There are other things we can do rather quickly with this table that reveal some preliminary
            insight into the statistics across the entire collection.
          </p>
          <p>With the data now at hand, let's investigate through visualising this set of data to see if any patterns emerge.</p>

            indicating a poorer sentiment in terms of the tone of the document. Each document was sent to be scored by the machine,
            which is then analyzed based on the textual contents of the document as a whole instead of using targeted phrases.

              When ordered by <code>year_published</code>, the poems spanning from 1909 to 1922 generally show a trend
              of negative sentiment. The sentiment score was returned on the overall document that was passed over to the
              Watson API for analysis. Frost's "The Road Not Taken" is not spared from the general sentiment of negativity
              (according to Watson) as well, with a sentiment score of <code>-0.685</code>.

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p>With the whisker plot shown on the left, we can see that Frost's "The Road Not Taken" lies beyond the lower bound
            of the overall negative sentiments of all his poetry written in this corpus.</p>
            <p>This makes "The Road Not Taken" an <strong>outlier</strong> in terms of its negative sentiment, as it is the only outlier in the set of
            negative sentiments. This makes "The Road Not Taken" more negative in its sentiment score than the others with a score of
            <code>-0.68531</code>.</p>
            <p>It thus seems that "The Road Not Taken" is an unusually bitter piece written, albeit scored by a machine in terms of
            detecting negativity in tone.</p>
